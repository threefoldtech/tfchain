# **TFchain go client**

- This library is a go implementation of a client for the TFChain.
- Internally, our own [fork](https://github.com/threefoldtech/go-substrate-rpc-client) of <https://github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client> is used to make substrate rpc calls.
- Used in multiple repos like [zos](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos), [rmb-go](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rmb_go), and [terraform-provider-grid](https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid).

## **Usage**

To make substrate calls:

- First, start a substrate connection against the desired url for the chain:

  ```go
  manager := NewManager("wss://tfchain.grid.tf/ws")
  substrateConnection, err := manager.Substrate()
  ```

- These are the urls for different chain networks:
  
  - devnet:  <wss://tfchain.dev.grid.tf/ws>
  - testnet: <wss://tfchain.test.grid.tf/ws>
  - qanet:   <wss://tfchain.qa.grid.tf/ws>
  - mainnet: <wss://tfchain.grid.tf/ws>

- It is the user's responsibility to close the connection.

  ```go
  defer substrateConnection.Close()
  ```

- Then, a user could use the provided api calls to communicate with the chain. like:

  ```go
  contractID, err := substrateConnection.CreateNodeContract(identity, nodeID, body, hash, publicIPsCount, solutionProviderID)
  ```

- Also, if a connection is closed for some reason like timing out, internally, it is reopened if nothing blocks.
- All provided api calls are found under the Substrate struct.

## **Run tests**

  To run the tests, you could either run it against a local docker image of the TFChain, or against devnet

- ### **Run against local docker image**

  To run tests against a local docker image of tfchain, you need to set CI environment variable to anything actually.

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 9944:9944 threefolddev/tfchain:2.2.0-rc8 --dev --ws-external
  sleep 3
  export CI="true"
  go test . -v
  ```

- ### **Run against devnet**

  ```bash
  unset CI
  go test . -v
  ```

### **Test Coverage**

- 30.6% of statements

## **Workflows**

- ### **Test**
  
  - This workflow runs all tests found in the root directory against a local docker image of the [TFChain](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain) found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/threefolddev/tfchain).

- ### **Lint**

  - This workflow ensures linting, so make sure to run these commands without any errors before pushing code:

    ```bash
    golangci-lint run
    ```

    ```bash
    gofmt -d -l .
    ```
