# Development

In this document we will explain how the bridge works and how you can setup a local instance to develop against.
The local instance will consist of a connection between a tfchain that runs in development mode and Stellar Testnet.

See [architecture](./architecture.md) for more information on how the bridge works.

## Development setup

Refer to [development](./development.md) for more information on how to setup a development instance.

## Production setup

Refer to [production](./production.md) for more information on how to setup a production instance.

## Bridging

When you have setup the bridge in either development or production mode you can start bridging.

See [bridging](./bridging.md) for more information on how to bridge.
