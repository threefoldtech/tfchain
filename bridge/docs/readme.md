# Development

In this document we will explain how the bridge works and how you can setup a local instance to develop against.
The local instance will consist of a connection between a tfchain that runs in development mode and Stellar Testnet.

See [architecture](./architecture.md) for more information on how the bridge works.

## Development setup

Refer to [development](./development.md) for more information on how to setup a development instance.

## Production setup

Refer to [production](./production.md) for more information on how to setup a production instance.

## Bridging

When you have setup the bridge in either development or production mode you can start bridging.

See [bridging](./bridging.md) for more information on how to bridge.

## Log schema
Bridge validators use simple event log for the sake of improving observability and perform tracing on workflows and data.
you can find more about the log schema and how it can improve the observability of the system in [the bride observability document](./observability.md).
