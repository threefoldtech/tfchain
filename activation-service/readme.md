# Substrate funding service

A TFChain Wallet account requires a minimum balance to exist and function. New TFChain users will not automatically have any tokens (also not on stellar).
Â Therefore an activation service for new TFChain wallets is created. It activates new TFChain wallet addresses by depositing a minimal amount of TFT (currently 1 TFT).
