# Using POS for tfchain

Questions to resolve:

- Can we transition from aura/grandpa to POS?
- Test what happens if 90 % of the validators are suddenly offline (if they are run on the grid for example and there is a problem).

## Using vested tokens to paricipate in POS

Vested tokens are locked on the Stellar network.

There is a possibility to have the vested tokens to be used in the POS.

We could issue the vested tokens on tfchain on an account with the proper security measures and nominate a validator.
Slashing might be a problem but this can be turned off for the validator of the vested accounts if needed.

I'm not going more in to detail on this topic as the other ones are more important at the moment.
