# Sample Hydra Project

This is a sample project generated by `hydra-cli scaffold`. Experiment by modifying `schema.graphql` and the mappings in the `mappings` folder.

## Prerequisites

* Node v14x
* Docker

## Bootstrap

```sh
npm ci

# Start postgres instance
docker-compose up db # add optional -d flag to detach from terminal

# Apply pending migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Apply migrations related to processor's state keeping tables
npm run processor:migrate

# Now you can start processing chain data
npm run processor:start

# The above command will block
# Open separate terminal and launch graphql server to query the processed data
npm run query-node:start
```

## If you want start from scratch

```sh
# Delete database migrations and other generated files
rm -r db generated types

# Write down your schema.graphql

# Analyze schema.graphql and generate model/server files
npm run codegen

# If necessary, create the database
npm run db:create

# Analyze database state and create migration to match generated models
npm run db:create-migration

# Review typegen section of manifest.yml

# Generate type definitions for substrate events and extrinsics
npm run typegen
```

## Configuration

Project's configuration is driven by environment variables, defined in `.env`,
and `manifest.yml`. For more details see https://docs.subsquid.io.

## Self-hosted indexer

It is recommeded to use already set up indexer if available, as new indexer typically
requires some time to catch up with interesting events.

Have a look at `./indexer/docker-compose.yml` for example of how you can set up a self-hosted version.
