# Creating And Funding An Account on TFChain Development network

## Step 1: Browse to the Polkadot JS Apps UI

You can use these link to access it:
- Using a public node: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://tfchain.dev.grid.tf/ws#/
- Using a private node: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944/ws#/


## Step 2: Enable in-browser Account Creation

To enable account creation on Polkadot-JS UI, navigate to the Settings tab. In the account options, choose `allow local in-browser account storage` and click Save.

Note: This option is provided for advanced users with strong backup policies. It is recommended that you store all keys externally to the in-page browser local storage, either on browser extensions, signers operating via QR codes or hardware devices. 

## step 3: Navigate to the "Accounts" page

Should look something like this:

- Once pressed you'll see a 12-word mnemonic phrase. Save it safely (Make sure to save your mnemonic phrase now, as there is no way to view it after the account is created) and check the box saying you have done so and press next.
- Enter a name for your account in the Name field. This is just a label for your convenience and does not affect the functionality of the account.
- Enter a password for your account in the Password and Confirm Password fields. This is used to encrypt your private key locally and protect your account from unauthorized access.
- Optionally, you can choose a different derivation path for your account in the Advanced creation options section. This is an advanced feature that allows you to generate different accounts from the same seed phrase. You can leave it as default if you are not familiar with it.
- Optionally, click on the Advanced creation options section to expand it.
    - You will see a drop-down menu labeled Key type. This is where you can select the type of cryptographic algorithm for your accountâ€™s key pair.
    - The default option is sr25519, which is a Schnorr signature scheme that offers high performance and security. You can also choose ed25519, which is an Edwards curve signature scheme that is widely used and compatible with many platforms. Both options support Substrate-based networks and Polkadot.

- After you select your preferred key type, you can proceed to click on the Save button and create your account.

## Step 5: Fund your account

- On the same page, on the left top, hover over `Account` button and click on `Transfer`.
- First select account `Alice` and secondly select your newly created account from the list.
- Send any amount to your account.
